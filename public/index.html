      <small>Things I do when I'm bored. I generally spend all my day doing useful things for work. What I build in spare time are not always useful. </small>

      <h3 onclick="location.href='https://cloud-notepad.herokuapp.com/'" class="borderLeftRight"> Shared notepad</h3>
      <div class="desc">
        <p> The tool I needed before I moved to Apple. Sharing clipboard between phone and the PC is very useful to me.
        This tool generates a unique URL and a QR code to that URL so it can be read from phone. Everytime you save the note, simply refresh the page on the phone to acess the updated note.</p>
        <small>Might not work now. I used mLab which moved to MongoDB Atlas :( </small></p>

      <br><small>Work in Progress.</small>
      <div class="desc">
      <p> 2020 has been great in converting the world to a work from home culture and in-turn reducing our carbon footprint on the <span class = "clickable" onclick = "location.href= 'https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/'">Earth</span> a little.
      </p>
      <p>You know what else it has done? Increased the number of meetings, a lot. </p>
      <p> The point of this tool is to help analyze how much time I spent on the meetings in a given number of days. </p>

      <h3 onclick="location.href='timer.html'" class="borderLeftRight"> The Color Clock</h3>
      <div class="desc">
      <p> The numbers have taken over our lives from a long time. What if threw that away and used colors instead?
      The Color Clock aims at exactly that, by displaying time in hex colors. Doesn't it feel great to say Aubergine O'clock instead of 9 O'clock?
